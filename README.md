# Lifting-Table
The model lifting table simulates a discontinuously working lift for unit loads as used in packaging industries. The palette lifting unit consists of a roller conveyor (gravity-driven) and two power-driven conveyor chains, one of them being fi xed, one being portable in its vertical axis. The simulated process shows a palette being moved horizontally and vertically by three conveying units: The palette is transported to the portable conveyor chain in its low-end position by the roller conveyor. Its drive runs until the palette has reached a specifi ed position. An inductive proximity switch indicates this positi- on. After this the conveyor chain gets lifted to its upper end position, which has the same level as the fi xed hauling system. Both drives run to transfer the palette onto the fi xed unit. As before, the palette gets transported to a specifi ed position, indicated by an inductive proximi- ty switch. The powerdriven components of the model are fi t to run back this sequence of operation.
